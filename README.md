### Folder structure
TODO describe the folder structure and where to put the data, additional data, model-weight files, ...

## Extra Data Collection
Using additional-data/collect_data.py script and additional-data/input_cities.csv parameters, 
extra data (1000 image pairs each) from 5 large US cities has been collected.

# Models

### baseline-cnn
Code based on https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/outreach/blogs/segmentation_blogpost/image_segmentation.ipynb .
To reproduce the baseline, simply run the jupyter notebook located at baseline-cnn/baseline-cnn.ipynb

### baseline-graph-cut
TODO

## Ensemble
TODO
first train the three ensemble models, then do this and that to get the final predictions.

### Mobilenetv2 based model with single spatial pyramid
TODO

### Xception based model with two spatial pyramids
TODO

### Xception based model with many spatial pyramids
TODO

# Results
TODO - do we add the results somewhere?
